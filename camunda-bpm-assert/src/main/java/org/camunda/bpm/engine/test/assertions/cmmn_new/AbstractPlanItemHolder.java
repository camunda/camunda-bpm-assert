/**
 * Provides an abstraction of plan items.
 * Plan items are represented as either CaseExecutions or HistoricCaseActivityInstances (and often both), making it hard to write test
 * code that provides meaningful error messages.
 * <p/>
 * An example:
 * Given a stage that is expected to be enabled but is falsely completed.
 * When trying to start the stage, the CaseExecution is needed, but a completed stage doesn't have that anymore!
 * To provide a meaningful error message ("cannot start stage, because it is state xxx"), the HistoricCaseActivityInstance
 * is needed.
 * <p/>
 * This class holds both CaseExecution and HistoricCaseActivityInstance.
