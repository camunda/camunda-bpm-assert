# Camunda Platform Assert User Guide

This project wants to make it easier to write tests for BPMN process definitions executed with [Camunda Platform](http://camunda.org). 
For that reason, a set of **assertions** based on Joel Costigliola's [AssertJ](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core) rich assertions library for java are provided as well as a few little **helpers** to make it a bit easier to drive you through your process.

### Advanced topics

#### Add Camunda Platform Assert to Eclipse

Eclipse will remove the static import, when it organizes the imports. Thus it is recommended to add camunda-bpm-assert to your 'Content Assist Favorites'. In Eclipse go to Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content Assist -> Favorites -> New Type... and add the following type:

```java
org.camunda.bpm.engine.test.assertions.ProcessEngineTests
```

#### Using a non-default process engine
 
In case you want to test with a process engine, which is neither the default engine,
nor the only one ramped up, you can bind a specific process engine to your testing 
thread by means of the following initialisation code. This makes the assertions aware 
of your process engine, e.g.:
 
```java  
   @Before
   public void setUp() {
     init(processEngineRule.getProcessEngine());
   }
```
